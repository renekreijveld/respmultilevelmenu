Responsive Multi Level Menu
===========================

Responsive Multi Level Menu is a Joomla 2.5/3.x module to display a responsive multi level menu.
This module is based on the original work of Mary Lou (Manoela Ilic) at http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/19/responsive-multi-level-menu/

Use the file **mod_resp_mlm_installer.zip** to install on your Joomla 3.x website.

The module has the defaule menu parameters which are the same as the original Menu Module.

Additionally, you can set the following parameters:

- **Back text**: the text to appear on the "back" menu item when navigating into submenu's.
- **Color Set**: choose one of the 5 predefined color sets. Or choose "Use your own".
- **Color1**: when you choose "Use your own" as color set, choose your first color here. This color is used as the button color.
- **Color2**: when you choose "Use your own" as color set, choose your second color here. This color is used as the button hover color.
- **Animation**: choose one of the five animations.
- **Load jQuery**: specify if the module should load jQuery (from the Google API's). If your template already loads jQuery, set this parameter to "No".

Update version 0.3

The module now allows you to choose up to three different Joomla menu's. These will be combined into one multi level menu.
This can be handy if you have a main menu and one or more other menu's on your desktop website. You can combine these menu's into one menu for mobile.

Update version 0.2

The javascript code prevents a menu item that has subitems to be executed.
When clicked on such a parent item, the javascript displays the submenu and doesn't execute the link connected to the parent item.
To fix this, every parent item that has a submenu is cloned into the submenu as the first item.

A demo of this menu is running at http://www.avgm.nl.
Just narrow your browser screen, or view the website on a smartphone.
